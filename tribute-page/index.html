        <p id="tribute-info"> Pikachu was one of the most famous Pokemon, loved by fans
            across the world. He was Ash Ketchum's best friend and the most courageous 
            fighter. Unfortunately he got yeeted by another pokemon in the movie and 
            "died" (spoilers: he didn't actually die, Ash just had a cry about him and
            he came back to life).
